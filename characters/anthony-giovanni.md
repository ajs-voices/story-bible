## Description

Ant has dark brown hair and onyx colored eyes. He is 5'11" with a natural muscular build. His skin has a natural sun kissed color of all primeval vampires despite his skin's lack of ever seeing the sun. He has retractable fangs.

Ant typically wears all black - black jeans, with a black t-shirt and a black leather jacket and combat boots as it helps hide in the shadows better. He also carries a sword at his left hip and a pair of guns at the small of his back. His weapons are hidden from view by his vampiric powers (obfuscation).

When Ant feeds his eyes turn red. He can usually control it, but when he is particularly hungry he is not always capable of hiding his eyes.

## Biography

Anthony Giovanni II was born to Cari Giovanni and Antonio Giovanni, though it wasn't until Ant was full grown and centuries old before his father ever found out he had another son. His birth was a near impossibility as Embraced Vampires cannot bear children as a Primeval Vampire can. It is believed that Cari was only able to give birth to a living vampire because she bore the blood of all the Embraced blood lines and one of the first Primeval Vampires.

Ant's upbringing was far from normal as his mother was not a very loving parent. Cari took him with her on her missions and raised him the only way she knew how with the help of her Chevalier, Ryan Elliot and the other Lesser Chevalier that she called her family.

Even in infancy Ant craved blood, it had taken Cari and the others a while to figure out the problem with her son, but with blood added to each bottle until he was able to feed on his own they had stabilized his hunger. This was atypical for any known living vampire. But that wasn't Ant's only atypical feature. His skin was as sensitive to the sun as any Embraced Vampire and he came into his power at the age of seven, nearly 10 y ears before any other primeval vampire.

As soon as Ant was able to walk he began his training. When he came into his power more training began. While Ant would never officially become an Enforcer for The Council Cari trained him as one.

Over the centuries Ant became very good friends with Ryan - almost brothers. While Ryan never left his mothers side, Ant did, but he always returned to their side when his own mission and needs were completed. He tried to leave once when he was merely a 100 years old. But with in three years he was back by his mother's side.

While he was away he met his father for the first time. Tony Giovanni was hunting his own rogue vampire - a rarity among the primeval vampires when Ant found him in a bar. Ant hid who he was behind an obfuscation his father couldn't break. He knew his father was stronger in Empathy than in Shadow.

Their meeting had gone well and Tony didn't find out until another three centuries later that he and Cari had a son, and that had been pure accident.
