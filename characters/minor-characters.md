# Aaron Woolbright, ANI4, 22

Aaron Woolbright was a black Magnus of the Fire kind, 4th level, from some po-dunk town in Illinois.  His parents Nox learned were fairly low in the hierarchy of things.  Neither were Magnus, but they each had siblings that were, they could probably learn if they wanted to, but they preferred to not, Aaron was their aspiration, he could do no wrong.  They sent him letters and care packages almost on a weekly basis.  Nox would have been jealous if he had cared enough to think about Aaron.  But Nox never even made eye contact with the older boy.  He was the same age, but he seemed like so much more, he was larger and taller than Nox.  Nox let him believe he was stronger than he was too, lying about his designation whenever he could get away with it.  (Dae'lin caught him once in this lie, it didn't end well.)

# Dae'lin Rivera, MNAeATI5, 35 

Dae'lin is Nox's mentor as a child and his direct superior as an adult

Dae'lin is second in command of the Venatori Magnus, she is only out ranked by her father Matias Rivera, MNTAIAe5, 54.  Dae'lin is an instructor at the Venatori branch of the Imperordo for all Magnus there.  She ranks fifth among the Imperordo., Her father is third.

Description:  Dae'lin is 5'4", 120lbs, with a commanding presence making her seem large than she really is.  She has black locks that she very rarely binds, her hair flows to her waist in a soft natural wave.  Her dark brown eyes are framed in long eyelashes.  Dae'lin has a thin yet athletic frame like a runner, she is a strong warrior, an even stronger magnus and there is little that gets in her way.  She is routinely frustrated with her apprentices, one in particular.  

Dae'lin is kind and loving, but she is a strong woman, and that tends to get her in more trouble than not.  She doesn't back down from anything, even if it's dangerous. 

# Jason "Jace" Hill, ENAeE3, 22

Jason Hill was a white breed american boy from deep down south.  His accent got picked on almost more than Nox himself, but Jason was twice the size of Aaron.  Not fat, he was solid.  Jason was the only one in the room who could bend more than one element, but air and earth, 3rd level.  He needed the element in his hand to actually bend, but he could create them so he was essentially 3rd level.  But for air that was easy.  He was good with air and earth.  Jason carried a small bag of sand in his pocket. Jason was the only one of the three boys that Nox shared a room with that he actually got along with.

# Ross Cortes, ENE3, 24

Ross Cortes was a Hispanic Magnus.  Ross hailed from Houston, Tx, he wasn't nearly as captivated by the city as everyone else in their room was.  He'd grown up in one his whole life.  Ross was older than Nox by two years, he was the oldest in the room, yet he followed Aaron around like he was a lost puppy.  His hair was almost always greasy, he intentionally put oil in it to slick it back.  Nox thought he looked like some kid from the silly sing song movie Grease.  He even liked to wear the black leather that went with it.  He was an Earth Magnus, third level.

Abraham's mother, Karla Cox,  was exiled from the Eagle clan for having two children with in her 100 year cycle.  She took up with a human, married him and had Abraham.  

Abraham resents his mother's people.  He is continually looking for a way to take revenge upon those who carried out his mother's sentencing.  He finds a young fire starter on the streets and teaches him rudimentary control of his ability and begins to use him to take out his enemies.  

Description:  Abraham has a bald head with a dark brown goatee and eyebrows, deep set brown eyes.  He's almost always wearing a stern look, very rarely shows any emotion what so ever.  He's a silver loop earring in his left ear, a throw back from his youth.

# Levi Hughes, NNITAAe4, 16, Aeternus (Exuli)

Levi started showing sighes at the age of 5 that he was Magnus, but his parents ignored the facts, they didn't want to take him to become Magnus.  At the age of 10 his power manifested in a bad way, burning down their Chicago apartment.

Levi bounced from foster home to foster home, until he ran away at 14, he's been living on the streets of Chicago since then.  

Abraham Morgan finds the boy, and Morgan teaches Levi rudimentary control of his ability and begins to use him to take revenge upon those who exiled his family.

# Garrett Spencer, EIAeTA4, 38

Nox's fire starter trainer/abuser - member of CCB

Garrett was a good man before he met Nox at the age of 22.  The boy was an enigma to him and it took his best efforts to find a way to train the boy to control his abilities.  Specifically he only sparked when he was afraid or anxious, riding in an elevator wasn't a safe way to invoke his fear without hurting others or damaging property.  The only other way that Garrett could think to train the boy was violence.  He sparked whenever he was 'spanked' or so his mother had reported.  Garrett used that as a last ditch effort and when he sparked he had no other options.  At first he didn't like doing it.  But the boy soon started to comply and yielded to his every whim.  The power went to his head.  The power went far deeper than the control he could have over the boy.  Garrett never thought of himself in any particular way, but he would watch the boy's flesh and craved it in more carnal ways.  The boy was putty in his hands.  The last few months he took what he wanted from the boy and was astounded by how much he had enjoyed the carnality of it, the feeling of the tender flesh beneath him, not hardened or lined with age.  Pure and fresh.

The last day the boy was to see Garrett, the boy lashed out.  He set his teacher on fire.  It hadn't been long, the moments between the fire starting and the sirens starting but it felt like an eternity before the fire was out at the boys own hands.  Garrett reported the accident to the powers that be and complained to the boy's counsoler and the boy was remanded into detention for 3 months and would be removed from Garrett's tutelage.  The man who over saw the boy's course watched Garrett like a hawk after that.  So instead of using his students as play things, he went another course.  He found slightly older boys and girls of the human variety.  The internet was a wonderful tool and NYC was a big place.  Plenty of humans to prey upon.

It was this instance that lead Garrett to not only seek out his desires outside the compound but others who were angry at the Venatori.  In one of his searches Garrett found a man in a chatroom and they found a common understanding.  With in months of his recovery from the burns inflicted by the boy, Garrett was following a new creed, a new philosphy in life.  He still taught the younger generations, but he also preached that the Venatori were not the end all and be all of the supernatural world and that things needed to change.
