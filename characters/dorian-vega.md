### Notes for Cesari

Emilio and Kai exiled Karla Cox for having more than one child in her 100 year cycle.  Her last partner was reprimanded.  The second child was exiled with her.

About a year after Nox left New York Dorian was approached by the Council to begin procreation steps.  He'd been left alone up until that time.  But it seemed that he was going to be required to, in order to maintain his position... set by example they said.  He also learned at the same time that Dae'lin was also being pressured but it had been going on years before (before Nox left)  They both suspected that was the reason Nox had left without warning.

Dae'lin suggested Dorian find a female companion before having to procreate, to see if he even 'could'.  He did he left the City and he had intentions of finding Nox to talk since they hadn't had the chance before he left.  But Nox was out on a mission and no where near where he'd been based.  Dorian found a cute red head, he courted her and found a fondness for her, and he was able to preform as they said.  He stayed for a few months but she was pregnant stupid antibiotics and broken condoms...Dorian left but he left Stella's mother with contact information.  He'd provide for anything if needed.

Dorian gets a call before Cesari starts asking for a job near him, she needed help and if he was willing then the closer the better.  Dorian set Stella up with a guaranteed interview and job but she didn't k now it.
