## Biography

Born: 40AD (April 8th, 40AD)

Asher is the last Aeternus born with immortality.

Asher has several business degrees from different eras of his life's span.  

Asher Erikson has been his identiy for the past 4 years (2015).  He is the eccentric son of Vaschel Erikson his prior eccentric self.  He has a child who only exists in paper work Ember Erikson who is currently 9 (2015) and will be his next living identity.  Every 25 years Asher regenerates as a new person, it is how he has kept out of the Venatori's radar for so long.

Asher as his two prior selfs ago became bored, and decided to take up a new life as Vaschel early he went to the Academy for his 18th year.  He met Isla Holiday.  He feel in love and they conceived a child together.  At the age of 25 Vaschel took up the helm of Apex Unlimited and he and Isla fell out of touch and Isla found another man and married him.  They happily raised Vaschel's daughter.  Vaschel met his daughter once when she turned 5.  Vaschel died before his daughter tried to see him again.

For millenia the Asher personality has been manipulating the Venatori.  He has used their breeding program to create a perfect (in his eyes) race.  The ruling houses have become his little play ground.  He continually is arranging different blood lines into those most powerful houses.  These houses routinely produce strong Magnus, brilliant Scrin and powerful hunters.  Asher is looking for the reemergence of immortality, even in the smallest of forms.  That is his destiny.  

It had taken Asher lifetimes to figure out what his visions in his Ad Aetetam meant.  But when he did Asher spent his lifes work learning genetics,  business practices to fund his research and programs as well as funding the Venatori on a whole.  

Ash has three separate documented living identies.

1. Vaschel Eriksen - age 49 - ecentric 1966
