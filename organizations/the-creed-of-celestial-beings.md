# The Creed of Celestial Beings (CCB)

A cult of supernatural creatures that reject the Venatori's way.

The CCB is lead by two men.  Charles Saunders who happens to also be a werewolf is the muscle behind the CCB, and James Wright, who is a weretiger and handles the more political aspects of their organization.

The CCB has been around for milenia in one form or another.  The latest iteration of the cult has been predominately passivist in its actions against the Venatori.  Their initial philosphy was to educate the Venatori to the needs of the other supernatural races.  This has worked in their favor over the course of the prior generations.  But as the world changes so do the Venatori.  The CCB feel that the Venatori are cracking down harder on the nuances of their individual races because the human world is starting to notice their actions due to technology and a 'shrinking world'.

There are several factions within the CCB.  

1.  The first faction beleives that education of the Venatori is still the best course of action.
2.  A more violent group is taking a strong foothold in the groups leadership and more agressive actions are being presented and acted upon by the rapidly growing group.
3.  The third faction is small but steadily growing.  This faction wants to reveal the supernatural existance to the world at large and lobby for the same rights and laws the humans have.
  
## CCB Acts of Attrition

1995 April 19: Oklahoma City bombing: A truck bomb shattered the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children. Neo-nazi terrorists Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were convicted in the bombing.

2001 September 11: the September 11, 2001 attacks were carried out by Muslim extremists. The attacks killed 2,507 civilians, 72 law enforcement officers, 343 firefighters, and 55 military personnel, and were carried out using hijacked commercial airplanes to damage the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C. The 110-story skyscrapers in New York City were ultimately destroyed, and the Pentagon received extensive damage in the western side of the building. Building 7 of the World Trade Center was also destroyed in the attack, though there were no casualties. A fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania before it could reach its target.
