*****

The Aeternus were a race of supernatural beings who have been on earth since before the dawn of man. They have no creation myths, they just always have been.

They were a very small race limited to only a few hundred living at a given time. They were immortal. They beleive they were the first. And they beleive they had a right to everything they wished or desired. They were kings among kings.

Aeternus typically formed very small groups. Mating only to propagate the race at very specific intervals in their life. They mated once in their life time. Needless to say by the time the race of man was large enough to pose a problem the Aeternus were a dying race.

With humans, other supernatural creatures started to hunt on the human populace. The Aeternus took it upon themselves - the kings of the earth to protect the fragile race. They formed the Venatori - hunters who would police the supernatural creatures.

Aeternus had many gifts, the largest being their immortality. But they were stronger than humans, faster, and more agile. Their senses were extraordinarily sensative. But with all these gifts the Aeternus lacked large thinking. They were a very narrow minded race, which meant that once they started on a path it was very difficult to veer from it.

This flaw in their perception lead the Venatori to begin breeding with other races - in particular the humans to increase their mental strength.

The Venatori interbreed with the humans to the point that their immortality fled their DNA, but the remainder of their flaws and gifts remained though they were lessened still. But now their minds were expanded, they developed various gifts - enhanced abilities seen in humans, but now on a much larger, much stronger scale. When the first Magnus was born and the ability to bend the elements was discovered, the Venatori began strict control of what they allowed in and out of their blood lines. Breeding programs were created. Men and women who were unfit to continue their lines were steralized so no accidental contamination was added. Breeding with human's ceased for the purpose of enhanced children, furthur dilution of their gifts was not going to happen.

Eventually the Aeternus dismantled the Venatori, but the Venatori were too strong, too powerful and they erradicated all the Aternus left, leaving them to rule the planet in their steed.

But hiding among the Venatori one Aeternus still survives. He's gone to great lengths to hide his true heritage. He has gone by many names over the centuries. Today he is Asher Eriksen - CEO of Apex Unlimited and head of one of the 8 ruling families of the Venatori.
