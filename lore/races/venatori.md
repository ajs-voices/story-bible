# The Venatori
_(from latin for hunter: venator)_

The Venatori are a supernatural race of 'humans' whose sole purpose is to police the supernatural world.  Venatori are gifted with superhuman senses, strength, speed, endurance, agility, healing and typically some sort of mental 'enhancement'.  ie: photographic memory, empathic, prophetic, precognition

Venatori complete the Ad Aetatem (coming of age) ritual at the age of 18.

The Venatori are ruled by the Imperordo.  There are three branches/types of Venatori - the Venatori (the hunters), The Scrin (the archivists), and the Magnus (magic users).  The Magnus are the only branch that can be part of the hunters or the Scrin.

## The Imperordo
_(from latin order and command: ordo, impero)_
The orginzation that rules over all Venatori, defining their heirarchy, rules/laws of the supernatural world as well as overseeing the training of the future of the race.

The Imperordo is run from New York, New York in the present day. It migrated to the city that never sleeps during the industrial revolution from it's prior home in London, England. There are small sanctums in most major cities throughout the world. The London court still oversees some of the Eurasian training and oversight, but the rules, regulations and the majority of Magnus are trained in New York.

The Imperordo is a council made of the eight 'ruling' families of the Venatori headed up by the strongest and most powerful Magnus as tie breaker and overseer.

* Mark Green (leader*) - Magnus
* Jose Vega (Dorian's grandfather) - Scrin
* Kai Viddens (eldest living Viddens) - Venatori (Magnus)
* Matias Rivera (Dae'lin's father) - Magnus
* Asher Eriksen - Scrin
* Lynne Dowager (Anabel's grandmother) - Scrin
* Stephanie Stone - Venatori
* Matthew Haskins - Venatori
* Pierre Eskridge - Magnus

### Command Structure

Overall Leadership 
Mark Green - Leader of the Imperordo
Matias Rivera - Leader of the Magnus - Second in Command

These two handle insure that the organization runs smoothly.  They are the secret holders of the supernatural world.  They are the face of the Venatori.

Field Leadership
Dae'lin Rivera - Second in Command of the Magnus - Lead Field Hunter
Gary Kenyon - Second in Command Field Hunter

These two are in charge of making assignments in the field, and insuring that all hunters receive the proper training, equipment, etc.

Academic Leadership
Richard Weston - Venatori Headmaster
Dorian Vega - Venatori Archivist (Scrin) - Lead Ad Aetatem

The Headmaster insures that all Venatori are trained properly, including the Venatori Magnus.  The Archivist is the law when it comes to the documentation of testing and mentorship.

The Scrin Leadership
Dolores Vega - Watcher
Douglas Rogers - Second in Command to the Watcher

## Ad Aetatem

The Ad Aetatem consists of three parts - first the child and parents sever ties in a ritualistic ceramony of sacrafice of a small woodland creature and symbolically tying the three together with the intestines of the animal after which an elder cuts them free, severing all bonds.

The second is a drug induced vision quest, upon which the child enters a dream like state and views his what is believed to a message from the universe.

The third part is a simple tribal tattoo inked to the right temple - a pair of crossed swords. If during the inking process the child makes a noise, they must wait another year to complete the ritual again.

The Magnus have an additional test is administered first which tests their skill and power levels as if an instructor had given their assent. It is no different than prior test.  A Magnus must reach a level of Adept before they are allowed to partake of any other aspects of the Ad Aetatem

Minorem are tested for specific antibodies before being allowed into any progeny program starting after their Ad Aetatem.  If criteria are not met then the they are not allowed into the progeny program, and they are steralized.

## Minorem (Lesser Venatori)
On occassion Venatori mate with humans, typically it is an accidental pregnancy while enjoying themselves away from their duties.  It is rare for a male Venatori to sire offspring in such a manner, the human female is unable to carry to term.  If she happens to carry to term the odds of survival are small.  In 75% of to-term cases both mother and child die during labor.  There is a 0.5% chance that both mother and child survive the birthing process, in 100% of these cases the child is a natural Magnus, the magic of the child allowing the mother to survive.  The remaining percentage of Venatori children born to a female human survive where the mother does not.  Normal pregnancy birth rates apply to female Venatori who become with child from a male human.

Minorem have a small likelyhood of containing the specific genetic make up to enter the Progeny programs.  Most minorem are sterlized unless there is a need for a specific set of markers of a given Minorem.  Which abilities a child receives from their Venatori half is indetermante at birth and can only be tested during their training.

## Humans in the venatori
Humans are not typically raised to be venatori, they are usually found after having been traumatized by a supernatural event that their only real course of survival is to become one.  A human venatori must go through the Ad Aetatem, typically done after 5 years of intensive training, however those raised from a child are treated as Minorem.

## The Scrin
_(from latin for achivist: Scriniarii)_
Venatori whose sole existance is to record history. Each Scrin typically devotes their life to a very small niche of history. Very few Scrin focus on more than that one little niche.


## The Venatori (branch)

The Venatori are a world wide organization, they have six headquarters. 

* New York, New York - This facility is the training ground for all Venatori They also monitor the Eastern US and Canada.
* Boulder, Colorado - The Rocky Mountain facility monitors the Western North American mountain Ranges and Mexico for their unique supernatural creatures. They also offer training in survival at extremes.
* London, England - The Island facility monitors all of the European supernatural creatures
* Beijing, China - The Asian facility monitors all of Asia and Japan
* Sydney, Austrailia - The Outback faciility monitors the southern hemisphere island supernatural creatures, and also offers training in some of the deadliest creatures supernatural and mundane alike
* Basilia, Brazil - The Brazilian facility monitors all of South and Central American supernatural creatures.

### Training
Most Venatori are trained from birth to police the supernatural. It starts out simple, taught by their parents, until they are 13 years old, then they are sent to their special training facility in New York where they are taught how to hunt, kill and/or capture the supernatural elements of the world. They spend 5 years training before they are let out into the world to do their work.

When individuals outside the Venatori shows promise, or has befallen a great tragedy at the hands of the supernatural, the Venatori have a choice, they can wipe the memories from the victim, or pull them into the Venatori. My most Venatori standards it is more harmful to wipe a memory than it is to teach them their way. But not everyone is cut out to hunt monsters, so mind wiping had become the default practice except for children who's minds are still highly impressionable.

Venatori who are also Magnus are subject to different training and different rules as they are firstly governed by the Magnus branch. However the Venatori and Magnus work together in close proximity training all Magnus in the NYC facility. 

## The Magnus

### Heirarchy

A Magnus can be a natural or can be taught when they come of age, this is important in the heirarchy of the Magnus culture. Nativus (natural) are higher ranked than Eruditus (learned) in most cases. There is a rare occurance of Eruditus outranking a Nativus magnus because of sheer power and skill, but that is atypical.

There are four elements - Ignis (fire), Aqua (water), Terra (earth), Aeris(air). A Magnus is clearly defined by his or her element and ability. A fire magnus who was born with the ability to bend the element is called an Nativus Ignis Magnus or NIM.

If a magnus can bend more than one element their primary is listed first (ie: NITM - fire and earth), and all others follow except for a Cesari, which is just an NC. There have been no cases of a Cesari who was taught to bend all four elements in recorded history.

There are 5 levels of power. Typically a magus is at one power level throughout the entire course of their lives, however on a rare occassion with enough training a magus may attain a new level. 

Power, Skill (Novice, Adept, Expert, Master), Elements and Inate ability to bend the elements determing a magnus rank and designation with in the heirarchy of the Imperordo (from latin order and command: ordo, impero).

A natural born Master of the highest power of any one element outranks all others except a Master Cesari.

Each Magnus tends to add the desgination to their names when confiring within the Imperodo. 

For Example a master of the hightest power in fire who was natural born who's name is John Doe would indicate his name as such: John Doe, MNIM5

A novice third level cesari: NNC3

An expert second level taught magnus in earth and water: EETAe2

The hierarchy is determined in the following order: Skill level, Inate ability, Power level and then age.

## Power Levels

Rank 1 - Must touch the element to manipulate it
Rank 2 - Can manipulate the element from a distance
Rank 3 - Can duplicate the element from a source to create more of that element to use
Rank 4 - Can pull the element from small traces like air particles, dust, heat/cold from the atmosphere etc.
Rank 5 - Can create the element from nothing

## Training

A Nativus Magnus typically immerges at a young age - typically around the age of 6 or 7, the earliest recorded was age 3. The child didn't survive much longer than that as he was unable to understand his ability at that early an age.

Without training a Nativus can destroy ones self with ease, as the powers can tear one's body apart if the control is not found/taught. 

At the age of 10 every Aeternus and Dimieater is tested to see if the can be taught to control the elements. If they can be taught the choice is given, if a child chooses not to become Magnus, their abilities are pulled from them, leaving them near shells of what they once were, becoming Tacet _(latin for silent)_, most parents encourage their children to learn, being Magnus is a responsibility but it is also a gift bestowed upon the family.

Every Magnus is designated upon entry to the Imperodo with an ability status of Novice and a power level that is determined in their testing. For each rank of skill level a new test is preformed, it determins their skill level and their power. It is rare that power levels increase. Each skill/level test is preformed at the students instructors request, and not before.

All students must become Adept before they are allowed to take their Ad Aetatem. If they have come of age but not rerached Adept they remain students until Adept skill level is reached. There are rare occasions upon which a student never reaches Adept and choose to become Tacet.

While it is rare, some Magnus develope outside of the Imperodo, once these souls are found they are given the same two options as Eruditus - join or become Tacet.

## Cesari 
_(from latin for alchemist: Cesarem)_
A Magnus with the ability to bend all four elements at the same time.

### Elemental Testing

Earth - manipulate sand
Water - fill a glass
Air - blow a bubble

###  Current Rankings

1. Mark Green, MNC5 - Leader of the Imperordo*
2. Nox Durante, MNC5 (main character)*
3. Matias Rivera, MNTAIAe5 - Leader of the Venatori Magnus
4. Charolette Osbourn, MNITAAe5
5. Dae'lin Rivera, MNAeATI5  - 2iC of the Venatori

* Age determines the difference between Mark and Nox.  However Nox is far stronger in all elements than Mark, but since there is nothing higher than a 5, Mark is defacto leader.  (not that Nox wants it to begin with)

# Other Supernatural Beings Under the Aeternus

* Vampires (per common lore - NO sparkling vampires)
* Lycanthropes (Most large preatory mammals have a version of the lycanthropy virus)
* Ghosts (per common lore)
* Demons (per common lore)
* Dragons (per common lore & dragons can take the form of a human)
* Monsters (monsters of myths and legends that are real fall under the Aeternus control)- very broad category if you can find legnds about it it can be used easily enough
 

# Financial Situations

The Venatori are funded by various holding subsidaries owned by the 'race' as a whole.  The Venatori individuals do not own have money of their 'own' to speak of.  It's a matter of providing for the whole.  A person works, they are given a stipened for extras - things like extraneous funishings, dinners out of the various compounds, extravegance and luxuries.  All basic living necesseties are provided for on the compound.  If a Venatori chooses to live out of the compound they are given a yearly salary and are required to pay for everything with that salary.

As an individuals status raises in the Venatori certain extras are given to a person.  A single person is given a studio apartment on the first level of the adult residences.  A single person with one to two children living with them is afforded a two bedroom apartment on that same level.  Three or more children regardless of the number of parents is given a three bedroom place on the second level of the adult residences.

A committed couple with no children is given a one bedroom apartment on the second level.  A committed couple with less than three children is given a two bedroom on the second level.  A couple with more children is given a three bedroom on the third level of the adult residences.

The above is regardless of status.  The higher the status of a person higher the person moves up in extravegance of their living arrangements.  A single person with high status can live in the lap of luxury all on the Venatori dime.
