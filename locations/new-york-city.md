# New York City

New York City is much like the the city of which it is [modeled after](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City) in the real world.  Almost all of the buildings in the world are fictional peices of work.  Though some famous places are used.  The biggest difference is how the supernatural undercurrents lie with in the City itself.  The differences from [the real world](https://www.nycgo.com/) are what we will focus on.  All persons used are fictional, especially those in any [position of power](https://www1.nyc.gov/).
